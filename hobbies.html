    <h1>MY - HOBBIES</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Coding (Personal Projects):<br>
        Many developers code for fun outside of work, working on personal
        projects or contributing to open-source initiatives.
        <li>Gaming:<br>
        Playing video games, especially ones that involve problem-solving or
        strategy, is a common hobby among developers. Some even enjoy creating
        their own games.</li>
        <li>Reading:<br>
         Whether it's technical books related to
        programming languages or genres entirely unrelated to tech, reading is a
        popular hobby among developers.</li>
        <li>Music:<br>
         Playing musical
        instruments, composing music, or simply listening to various genres of
        music is a common way for developers to unwind.</li>
        <li>Fitness and Sports:<br>
         Exercise, gym workouts, running, or participating in team
        sports provide a break from coding and help maintain a healthy
        lifestyle.</li>
        <li>Art and Design:<br>
        Some developers have a creative side
        and enjoy activities like drawing, painting, graphic design, or UI/UX
        design, finding it as an outlet for creativity.</li>
        <li>Cooking/Baking:<br>
        Experimenting with recipes and cooking techniques can be a relaxing and
        rewarding hobby for developers.</li>
        <li>DIY and Electronics:<br>
        Building hardware projects, experimenting with Arduino or Raspberry Pi, or
        tinkering with electronics is a hobby that aligns with their technical
        interests.</li>
        <li>Photography/Videography:<br>
        Capturing moments, editing photos or videos, and experimenting with visual storytelling is a hobby
        that some developers enjoy.</li>
        <li>Traveling and Exploring:<br> 
        Discovering new places, cultures, and experiences is a hobby that helps developers
        unwind and gain fresh perspectives. These hobbies not only offer a break
        from the technical aspects of software development but also provide
        opportunities to explore different interests, relax, and foster
        creativity, which can often positively impact their professional work as
        well.
